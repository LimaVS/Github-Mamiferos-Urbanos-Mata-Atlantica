REF_ID: Reference identification that links the references to a specific record in the dataset	
ORDEMBD: Identification code of each species record. Each code is exclusive and represents the record in the sampling area. Records made in the same area in different studies received different codes
STUDY_AIM: Information about the objective of the study. ABD: the objective of the study was to obtain quantitative population data (abundance, density) of a given species; ABD-COMM: the objective of the study was to inventory the entire primate community in a given area, in addition to obtaining quantitative population data of all or some of the species
SPECIES: Species name in that sampling area	
SP_ORIGIN: Information about the origin of that species in that sampling area. Autochtone: if the species is native to that sampling area. Allochtone: if the species is introduced or exotic in that sampling area. Hybrid: If individuals are the result of hybridization between species in the sampling area	
POP_STATUS: Information about the conservation status of the populations. Extinct: the population is extinct; Probably extinct: the population is probably extinct, but a confirmation is necessary.	
SITE: Name of the sampling area provided by the reference paper	
AREA_HA: Area of the sampling site in hectares provided by the reference paper
MUNICIPALITY: Municipality of the sampling site
STATE: State or province of the sampling site
COUNTRY: Country of the sampling site
LONGITUDE_X: Longitude corrected and transformed into decimal degrees (datum WGS84)	
LATITUDE_Y: Latitude corrected and transformed into decimal degrees (datum WGS84)	
PRECISION: Coordinate precision of the sampling site. Precise: if the coordinate reported is from the exactly sampling area; Not precise: if the coordinate is from the municipality of the sampling area, or the coordinates provided by the paper mismatches with the sampling area	
UC: Information about the protection of the sampling area. Yes:if the area is a conservation unit or is within a conservation unit; No: If the area is not a conservation unit
