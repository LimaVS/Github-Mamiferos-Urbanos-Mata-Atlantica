Nome do arquivo: Atlantic_pollination_dataset
id: Identification of each interaction sampled. The codes are not exclusive, and the same code represents the same interaction but with different deposition of pollen in the animal’s body
latitude: Latitude in decimal degrees (GCS – WGS84) from the locality where the interaction was observed
longitude: Longitude in decimal degrees (GCS – WGS84) from the locality where the interaction was observed

pollinator_group: Major type of vertebrate	
bodypolendeposition: Place of pollen deposition on pollinator’s body	
behaviour: Feeding behavior of nectar-feeding vertebrates on flowers. Legitimate pollinators touched the flower’s reproductive structure with its body. Larcenists visited flowers but did not touch the reproductive structures of the flowers. 	
relativefrequency: Calculated as the number of visits in a species of plant by a species of nectar-feeding vertebrate by the total number of visits in this species of plant in each latitude and longitude (=community)
